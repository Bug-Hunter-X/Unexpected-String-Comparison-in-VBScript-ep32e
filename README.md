This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript related to implicit type coercion during comparisons.  The `bug.vbs` file contains code that incorrectly compares strings as numbers. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with explicit type conversion.  This illustrates the importance of handling data types explicitly in VBScript to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure reliable code.
